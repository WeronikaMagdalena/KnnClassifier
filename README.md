# KNN Classifier

This Java program implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification tasks. The classifier is designed to work with a normalized dataset and provides methods for classification and accuracy calculation. The program includes randomization to ensure robust training and test splits.

## Overview
The KNN Classifier is a simple yet powerful tool for classification tasks. It works by identifying the k-nearest neighbors to a given instance and assigning the most common class among these neighbors to the instance. This implementation includes:
- Randomized splitting of the dataset into training and test sets.
- Distance calculation using Euclidean distance.
- Accuracy calculation to evaluate the classifier's performance.
