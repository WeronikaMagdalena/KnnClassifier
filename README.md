# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

## Overview
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies new data points based on the majority vote of its K nearest neighbors in the training dataset.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Choose the Number of Neighbors (K)**: Determine the number of nearest neighbors to consider (K). This is a small positive integer.
2. **Calculate Distance**: Compute the distance between the new data point and all points in the training dataset using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
3. **Identify Neighbors**: Select the K points in the training data that are closest to the new data point.
4. **Vote for Labels**:
    - **Classification**: Assign the label that is most common among the K-nearest neighbors.
    - **Regression**: Calculate the average (or weighted average) value of the K-nearest neighbors.
5. **Assign Class**: Classify the new data point based on the majority vote or average value.

## Distance Metrics

Commonly used distance metrics include:
- **Euclidean Distance**: \( d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2} \)
- \[ d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2} \]
- **Manhattan Distance**: \( d(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^n |p_i - q_i| \)
- **Minkowski Distance**: \( d(p, q) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |p_i - q_i|^p \right)^{1/p} \)

## Choosing K

- **Small K**: Can lead to overfitting and high variance, making the classifier sensitive to noise.
- **Large K**: Can result in a smoother decision boundary with lower variance but may ignore small patterns (higher bias).

A common method to determine the optimal K is through cross-validation.

## Advantages

- **Simple and Intuitive**: Easy to understand and implement.
- **No Training Phase**: The model is ready for use once the data is available.
- **Adaptable**: Suitable for both classification and regression.

## Disadvantages

- **Computationally Expensive**: Inefficient for large datasets as it requires computing the distance to all points.
- **Memory Intensive**: Needs to store all training data.
- **Sensitive to Irrelevant Features**: Performance can degrade with irrelevant or noisy features.
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Effectiveness decreases as the number of dimensions increases.
